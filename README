===INTRO===

Yourik The Intergalactic Rabbit is the animal rights-themed arcade game.

===INSTALLATION===

To build Yourik from the source, you need GCC and Qt 5.x, SDL 2, SDL_Mixer libraries. 
If you have all them installed, just do as root:

qmake
make
make install

and then use "yourik" command to run the game.
Please note that Yourik uses OpenGL to draw its graphic, so if your videocard drivers have the bad OpenGL support, you'll get the bad game experience.


===LICENSE NOTES===
